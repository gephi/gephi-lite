# Gephi Lite - Changelog:

## 0.6.0 version aka FOSDEM 2025

This version has been developed in a one-week iteration organized at the [2025 Gephi Lite sprint](https://www.ouestware.com/2025/02/10/gephi-lite-0-6-en/), right before FOSDEM 2025.

### New features

- Possibility to use nodes degrees as a **dynamic attribute** along normal attributes in various places
- New visual variables: **Edges depth**, nodes/edges **color shading**
- New appearance option: **Crop node/edge labels** over N characters
- New button "**Select node neighbors**" in selected node options menu
- Gephi Lite **JSON file format**, to save/load graphs with their surrounding context (appearance, filters)
- The code structure has been refactored as a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo)
- New **[`@gephi/gephi-lite-broadcast`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gephi/gephi-lite-broadcast)** TypeScript library, to drive Gephi Lite from other web applications
- New "**Clone graph in a new tab**" button
- **Topological filters**: _k_-core, ego networks and largest connected components
- Visualising ambiguity in Louvain community detection (experimental)

## 0.5.2

This version is just published to allow testing scripting Gephi Lite, using the [BroadcastChannel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel) API.

## 0.5.1

various fixes:

- [#89](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-lite/issues/89): regression on show edges
- [#173](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-lite/issues/173): regression on performance due to layout metric
- boolean attributes not rendered correctly in terms Filter

Thanks to [@splines](https://github.com/Splines) for the bug reports

misc:

- upgrade Graphology Gexf to 0.13.2

## 0.5.0 version aka The 2024 Gephi week edition

This version has been developed in a one-week iteration organized at the [2024 Gephi week workshop](https://gephi.wordpress.com/2024/06/13/gephi-week-2024-peek-from-the-inside/).

Special thanks to [Anders Kristian Munk](https://github.com/akmunk), [Johan Irving SÃ¸lotft](https://github.com/Johansoltoft) and [Lasse Uhrskov Kristensen](https://github.com/watchforest) for testing the app and reporting ideas and issues.

### New features

- Dark mode
- Connected Closeness (experimental): in layout panel one can chose to compute and show the `Connected Closeness` metric. It provides a quality measure of the current layout [(jacomy 2023)](https://jgaa.info/index.php/jgaa/article/view/paper626). Note that the current implementation is still being tested and will most likely be updated.

### Enhancements

- Metrics can now indicate what kind of attributes they generate. We needed this to make sure that the Louvain Modularity was classified as a qualitative attribute although it outputs numbers.
- When creating an edge, the node select shows the last created nodes first to speed-up data edition experience. Thanks to [qkhanhpro](https://github.com/qkhanhpro) for reporting [this great idea](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-lite/issues/152)!
- Custom scripts modal now prevent data loss by warning users if script has not been saved before closing.
- Better User Experience in filters to avoid unwanted deletion
- Run your own [Gephi Lite instance through Docker](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-lite/#dockerfile-for-production)

### Debug

- [#160](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-lite/issues/160): Layout form input issues

- [#153](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-lite/issues/153): Boolean attributes not rendered correctly in node panel
- [#148](https://github.com/gephi/gephi-lite/issues/148): Graph data model update issues

## 0.4.2

## 0.4.0 version aka FOSDEM 2024

This version has been developed in a one-week iteration preceding the FOSDEM 2024 conference where we presented the [genesis of Gephi Lite](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3253-bridging-research-and-open-source-the-genesis-of-gephi-lite/).

### New features
